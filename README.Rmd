# GADGET: Gaussian Process Approximations for Designed Experiments

The `GADGET` package computes optimal Bayesian experimental designs using Gaussian process optimization. At its core is the ability to calculate static designs that maximize a design criterion that may be either deterministic or stochastic. In particular, stochastic design criteria could be a Monte Carlo estimates of an expected utility based on MCMC posterior draws. `GADGET` utilizes the algorithm proposed by Weaver et al. (2016) <doi:10.1214/15-BA945> and performs Gaussian process validation using the statistics introduced by  Bastos and Oâ€™Hagan  (2009 <doi:10.1198/TECH.2009.08019>. The `parallel` package is integrated to parallelize the evaluation of the user's design criterion.  Additionally, `GADGET` has wrapped the optimization into a sequential routine to perform sequential computer experiments that automatically call simulator code that is available in R.

## Installation

To install `GADGET` from github, use the `install_github` function from the `devtools` package.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('isaacmichaud/GADGET')
```
